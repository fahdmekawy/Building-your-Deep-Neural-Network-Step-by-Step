# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step
 
  By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
